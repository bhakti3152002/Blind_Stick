Ultrasonic Sensor with Servo, LED, and Buzzer
This Arduino project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and activate a servo motor, LED, and buzzer when an object is detected within 20 cm.

#How It Works
Measures distance with ultrasonic sensor.
Activates LED, buzzer, and rotates servo to 90° if object < 20 cm.
Deactivates LED, buzzer, and returns servo to 0° if object > 20 cm.

#Setup
Copy code to Arduino IDE & upload.
Assemble components.
Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to view distance.

#Notes
Adjust distance threshold in code.
Ensure accurate sensor placement.

#License
Open-source for personal projects.
